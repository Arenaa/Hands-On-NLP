This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects that explore various Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and applications. Through these projects,  I'm going to gain experience in working with data, building models, and evaluating the results. My goal is to provide a comprehensive yet accessible introduction to the world of NLP.
